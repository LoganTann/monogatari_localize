# atom-monogatari package

Adds snippets to your monogatari project.

Current Status : Not working bc i'm currently working on it.

I also want to do (after making snippets) :
* Project Mangager (creates easily a new monogatari project)
* Localization Manager (helps to translate your game and maintain every localizations over the time)
* Monogatari Docs ?
